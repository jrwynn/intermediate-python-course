# Intermediate Python Course

Hey there, 

In this course you will create a dice-rolling program using python. The code you create will be stored in the dice-roller.py file. This repo also contains course materials under the issues tab. 

this is my first online tutorial of any kind so im excited to have this experience and learn more about Python at the same time.
